# wsl2_docker_gatk
Recently (September 2021) I started studying genomic data analysis, an exciting and challenging field. I want to run some data analysis on my computer, so I've been reading how to do it in Windows because it is the OS that I've been using my whole life, and there is some excellent software that I rely on daily, which wouldn't be available on Linux. So I decided to document the steps I took setting up the environment and tools. I do not intend to explain the tools here. I am only reporting the exact commands I used after reading a lot of documentation.
